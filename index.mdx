## 🎯 What is SuperMCP?

SuperMCP is a **powerful platform** that enables you to create **multiple isolated MCP servers** using a **single standalone connector**. This unique architecture allows you to:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Multi-Server from One Connector" icon="clone">
    Deploy one connector instance and create unlimited isolated MCP servers with different configurations
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Isolated Configurations" icon="lock">
    Each MCP server has its own credentials, connection settings, and security tokens
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Resource Efficient" icon="gauge-high">
    Share connection pools and resources across servers while maintaining isolation
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Simplified Management" icon="sliders">
    Manage all your database connections from a single connector deployment
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### How It Works

Instead of deploying multiple connector instances for different databases, SuperMCP lets you:

1. **Deploy Once**: Set up a single PostgreSQL or MSSQL connector
2. **Create Multiple Servers**: Configure as many isolated MCP servers as needed
3. **Independent Access**: Each server operates independently with its own tokens and credentials
4. **Centralized Control**: Manage everything from one unified dashboard

This approach dramatically reduces infrastructure complexity while providing maximum flexibility for multi-tenant applications, development environments, and enterprise deployments.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

SuperMCP consists of three main components working together:

  alt="SuperMCP System Architecture"
  className="rounded-lg border border-gray-200 my-7 background"
/>

The architecture diagram above illustrates how the Dashboard and MCP Clients interact with the Application Layer, which then communicates with database connectors (PostgreSQL, MySQL) that manage multiple server instances connected to their respective databases.

## 📚 Core Concepts

### Connectors
Standalone microservices that implement MCP protocol to interface with specific data sources. Each connector runs independently on its own port.

### Servers
Instances of connectors with specific configurations (credentials, host, database). One connector can manage multiple servers.

### Tools
Callable operations exposed by connectors (e.g., `list_tables`, `execute_query`, `test_connection`).

### Templates
Pre-configured tool patterns with parameter validation for common workflows.

### Connection Pools
Managed connection pools with automatic cleanup, LRU eviction, and configurable limits.
