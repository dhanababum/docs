## What is forge-mcptools?

forge-mcptools is a comprehensive platform designed to simplify the creation and management of **Model Context Protocol (MCP) connectors**. It provides developers with a complete toolkit for building, deploying, and managing connectors that interface with various data sources including databases, REST APIs, and other services.

## Core Concepts

### MCP Connectors

A **connector** is a standalone service that provides a standardized interface to a specific data source. Each connector:

- Runs as an independent service (usually on its own port)
- Implements the MCP protocol for tool registration
- Handles connection pooling and resource management
- Provides tools for data access and manipulation

### MCP Servers

A **server** is an instance of a connector with specific configuration. Multiple servers can be created from a single connector:

```
PostgreSQL Connector (Port 8027)
  ├── Server 1: production-db (192.168.1.10:5432)
  ├── Server 2: staging-db (192.168.1.11:5432)
  └── Server 3: dev-db (localhost:5432)
```

### MCP Tools

**Tools** are the operations that a connector provides. For database connectors, typical tools include:

- `list_tables()` - List all tables in the database
- `get_table_schema(table_name)` - Get schema information
- `execute_query(query, params)` - Execute SQL queries
- `test_connection()` - Verify database connectivity

## Platform Components

### 1. Backend (FastAPI)

The backend service provides:

- RESTful API for all platform operations
- User authentication and authorization
- Connector registration and management
- Server lifecycle management
- Tool discovery and execution

**Port**: 8000 (default)

### 2. Frontend (React)

The web dashboard offers:

- Visual connector management
- Server creation and configuration
- Tool playground for testing
- Real-time status monitoring
- User management interface

**Port**: 3000 (default)

### 3. Connectors

Each connector is an independent service that:

- Listens on its own port (8027, 8028, etc.)
- Registers available tools with the backend
- Manages connections to the target data source
- Handles tool execution requests

## Workflow

Here's how the components interact:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connector Development">
    Developer creates a new connector based on templates (PostgreSQL, MSSQL, etc.)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connector Deployment">
    Connector is deployed as a Docker container or standalone service
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connector Registration">
    Connector registers with backend, advertising available tools
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Server Creation">
    User creates server instances via dashboard with specific configurations
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Tool Execution">
    User invokes tools through dashboard or API, backend routes to appropriate connector
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Architecture Benefits

### Scalability

- Each connector runs independently
- Easy horizontal scaling by adding more connector instances
- Connection pooling prevents database overload

### Flexibility

- Add new connectors without modifying core platform
- Support any data source (SQL, NoSQL, REST APIs, etc.)
- Customize tools for specific use cases

### Maintainability

- Clear separation of concerns
- Standardized connector interface
- Independent deployment and updates

## Data Flow

  ↓
Backend (FastAPI) - Authentication & Routing
  ↓
Connector Service - Connection Management
  ↓
Data Source (Database/API)
